    <p>  Fishermen in the cold sea</p>
    <p>  would not harm whales</p>
    <p> and the man gathering salt</p>
    <p> would look at his hurt hands.</p>
    <p>  Those who prepare green wars,</p>
    <p>  wars with gas, wars with fire,</p>
    <p>  victories with no survivors,</p>


    <p> If we were not so single-minded</p>
    <p> about keeping our lives moving,</p>
    <p> and for once could do nothing,</p>
    <p> perhaps a huge silence</p>
    <p> might interrupt this sadness</p>
