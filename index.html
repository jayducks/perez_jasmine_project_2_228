    <div id="line1"><p>Now we will count to twelve</p></div>
    <div id="line2"><p>and we will all keep</div> <div id=still>still</div>
    <p> for once on the face of the earth,
        <p>let’s not speak in any language;</p>
        <p> let’s stop for a second,</p>
        <p> and not move our arms so much.</p>
        <p> It would be an exotic moment</p>
        <p> without rush, without engines;</p>
    <p> we would all be together</p>
    <p> in a sudden strangeness.</p>
    <p>  Fishermen in the cold sea</p>
    <p>  would not harm whales</p>
    <p> and the man gathering salt</p>
    <p> would look at his hurt hands.</p>
    <p>  Those who prepare green wars,</p>
    <p>  wars with gas, wars with fire,</p>
    <p>  victories with no survivors,</p>
    <p>  would put on clean clothes</p>
    <p>  and walk about with their brothers</p>
    <p>  in the shade, doing nothing.</p>
    <p> What I want should not be confused</p>
    <p> with total inactivity.</p>
    <p> Life is what it is about;</p>
    <p> I want no truck with death</p>.
    <p> If we were not so single-minded</p>
    <p> about keeping our lives moving,</p>
    <p> and for once could do nothing,</p>
    <p> perhaps a huge silence</p>
    <p> might interrupt this sadness</p>
    <p> of never understanding ourselves</p>
    <p> and of threatening ourselves with death.</p>
    <p> Perhaps the earth can teach us</p>
    <p> as when everything seems dead</p>
    <p> and later proves to be alive.</p>
    <p> Now I’ll count up to twelve</p>
    <p> and you keep quiet and I will go.</p>
