# Project 2

by Jasmine Perez

#  overview

This project is a meant to display what community means to me using text and css transformations. I chose the text "Keeping Quiet" by Pablo Neruda as it is about unity and setting aside our differences. By taking a moment of silence, Neruda believes we will be able to see how truly similar we are no matter where we are or what we do for a living. 

# technical overview

(font assets not yet decided)

 I (will) have decided to use several css tranformations to make the text more meaningful visually.
